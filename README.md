# AI-Powered Car Lease & Loan Contract Negotiation Assistant

### Turn Complex Contracts into Smart Decisions

Buying a car often becomes stressful because contracts are filled with legal and financial jargon.  
This project builds an AI-powered assistant that can read, analyze, and help negotiate car lease or loan contracts just like a smart financial advisor.

The system extracts key information from contracts, detects unfair terms, compares with real market prices, and generates personalized negotiation suggestions for the user.

## 🎯 Project Vision

To help normal users understand car loan/lease contracts without legal knowledge by using Artificial Intelligence.

This system enables users to:

- Understand what is inside their contract  
- Identify hidden charges and risky clauses  
- Compare the contract price with market value  
- Receive AI-generated negotiation advice  

Our goal is to convert complicated legal documents into simple, actionable insights.
